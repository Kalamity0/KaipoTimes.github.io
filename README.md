# First of all, why is tourism such a big monopoly in Hawaii?
Tourism was started around the late 1800's to early 1900's when hawaii attracted the wealthy to visit an exotic and tropical area that they had 
never seend before. Eventually as flights and sailing trips became much cheaper and affordable to the average citizen many people began visiting 
hawaii as a luxury location and today thousands of people visit the islands every day, clogging up the roads and driving up prices for citizens.
Military officers also advertised Hawaii to their family and friends and the islands quickly became the go to place to visit not only in the US but in foreign countries as well as many other countries like Japan adore hawaii even to this day.

# What are the negative effects of tourism?
Tourism is infamous among residents like me for causing many problems in our lives such as creating traffic with tourists trying to drive in towns, inflating the economy to where housing is unaffordable for many residents, causing much more trash to end up on our roads and oceans, and the general focus on them opposed to the actual people who live on the islands. Our lives have been dictated on sastifying other people rather than focusing on our needs like affordable housing and reservations for native hawaiians. The blantant ignorance towards residents shows how little the government cares about us and the focus that is brought upon tourists that contribute to shareholders making more money. Traffic is the worst out of any state in the US due to the small size of the islands and towns and the fact that hundreds if not thousands of tourists walk the streets and drive in rented cars or taxis (Uber  and Lyft didn't exist in the 1990's guys). 

# COUNTERPOINT: What are the positive effects of tourism?
Tourism has greatly strengthened the US's economy as many foreigners travel to the islands to experience a tropical and exotic location like no other, and despite extremely expensive prices in hawaii business owners experience great profits and get to drown in wealth as the common people suffer. Many businesses have thrived for long off tourism, including locally owned ones such as food and gift shops, but this is a minority compared to the many big name brands that have established their dominance over the hawaiian economy and provide tourists many things to buy so they can fill their wallets. While tourism also creates many job opportunities, most of these jobs are either minimum wage or barely make above it, making them very unprofitable to work at and making so that workers are more miserable from dealing with tourists all day and having to come home to barely enough money to survive in this economy. 


# Why don't we support tourism?
While tourism can be a great economic booster when used in moderation, hawaii has swayed to the point where it's more focused on being a tourist spot rather than a place to live. Many businesses cater only to tourists in their products or services and less focus seems to be put on residents. If the system valued both residents and tourists equally. Currently our government only values the money it makes over the quality of life of it's local citizens and especialy it's native hawaiian populatuon that had been emancipated under the US's rule and put in a sort of slavery to it's government.
